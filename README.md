Be funny now Game WEB Server Responses.
# as of 6/16/2024 BFN has shutdown.
# you MAY have to clear your gamedata for your url/shit to work.
# i recommend using fiddler auto responser w/ https enabled if you just wanna test & purly static serving. ( GAME SERVERS WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
## MOST is for PC, i still have 0 clue on how to get this working on any mobile devices.

# how 2 use:
Put it on a web server and somehow trick the game into loading stuff from your domain or IP.

Note that this will not help hosting servers, as that's different.

but Be Funny Now uses Ubuntu as an OS. with UDP as the hosting method.
Note also that 'Login Into Steam' does not work  as BFN  does something under the hood.

Click on the folders.


or download Fiddler and setup https, request decryption, and launch Befunny now.
